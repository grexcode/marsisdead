<p><h2 align="center">History of Coding</h2></p>			
<p>Coding and computer programming are always changing and evolving. As coder nerds, it's exciting to think about how we can program computers to do complex things, and to look back into history and see that this has been happening for quite a while. Learn how programmers throughout time have imagined and invented new possibilities with programming and coding, and how they've used their (mostly mathematics) skills to make their ideas become a reality - something we deal with on a daily basis, thanks to them. We'll highlight a few big names and things concerning programming:<br><br>

<b>Heron of Alexandria</b><br>
Programming dates all the way back to 60 A.D., to the time of Mr. Heron of Alexandria. This fella was a mathematician and engineer who was known for his amazing inventions and machines. There was one machine in particular that perhaps sparked the evolution of computer programming - this specific machine had puppets on it, and underneath the machine were a series of strings that you could pull, to make the puppets do certain things. By simply re-wiring the machine or re-programming the machine, you could manipulate the puppets to do different things. So, that's one of the first recorded examples we know of where you could program or change the way something is operated without having to take it all apart and rebuild it.<br><br>

<b>Joseph Marie Jacquard</b><br>
Then, as far as computer programming, things went dark for quite some time. There was very little progress for the next 1,800 years or so. It was in France that the next influential programmer came along - Joseph Marie Jacquard - and took programming to the next level by inventing the "Jacquard loom". If you aren't too familiar with what a loom is, well, it's a giant machine that created certain patterns on carpets, rugs, and blankets. Basically, the French dude used a set of punch cards made of metal (much like early computer programming, imagine that) that he would stitch together and run through the loom, and the loom would read these cards and weave a pattern accordingly. Consider Jacquard the loom programmer, if you will.<br><br>

<b>Charles Babbage</b><br>
Towards the end of the 19th Century, someone in London, UK started to create waves in the programming world. He was a mathematician as well (surprise, surprise). Considered by some to be the "father of the computer", Charles Babbage invented the first mechanical computer, called the analytical engine, that others (whom we'll mention later) would then use as inspiration in their more complex, electronic designs and computers. But before that invention came to be, he had this dream of a machine that could perform calculations, and he called it the calculating engine. After asking Parliament for a fairly large budget to try and build the thing, he gave up halfway when he had a better idea - the analytical engine.</p>

<b>Analytical Engine</b><br>
So of course he went back to Parliament to ask for more money to build his new idea, to which you can probably guess Parliament's reply - "NO, finish what you started with the calculating engine." Babbage never did complete the calculating engine after having the better idea to build the analytical engine, and never got the money to be able to build that. So, with the calculating engine only partially built and the analytical engine only designed, Babbage never finished what he started. But, just because it wasn't built yet didn't mean you couldn't write "software" for it - and that's exactly what one person did, someone who worked very closely with Babbage. Her name was Augusta Ada Byron, Countess of Lovelace - but we'll call her Ada Lovelace.<br><br>

<b>Ada Lovelace</b><br>
Ada Lovelace was - you guessed it - a mathematician, and also technically the world's first computer programmer, who was intrigued by what Babbage had thought up with his analytical engine. So much so, that after an Italian dude had written a book about the analytical engine, she translated the book from Italian to English, and learned all about how the machine worked. So not only was she good with languages (see where we're going here?), she was in theory creating a program, or language, for this machine that didn't technically exist.<br>

Then, like before, progress with programming went quiet for some time until around the middle of the 20th Century, during World War II. This was when progress really started to take off, as far as modern computer programming. While the Germans had the Enigma machines to protect their communication during the war, the British (Allies) had Alan Turing. If you've seen the 2014 film The Imitation Game, you may recognize the name. If you haven't seen the film, you should see it - it has Benedict Cumberbatch in it - but we'll tell you why he's important.<br><br>

<b>Alan Turing</b><br>
Any guesses on Alan Turing's profession? Yep, another mathematician. Basically, this guy was "The Bombe". Let us explain. Doing top-secret work breaking military codes used by the Germans and Axis powers, Turin (with the help of his coding team) was able to crack the ever-changing 'Enigma' code by inventing a computing machine that helped reduce the work of code-breaking. This machine was called The Bombe. By breaking the code, the Allies were able to understand German naval movements. Definitely Bombe.com, right?<br><br>

<b>Tommy Flowers</b><br>
During the later stages of World War II, another British fellow made some progress in computer programming; a guy who actually wasn't a mathematician, but worked as an engineer in the British Post Office. His name was Tommy Flowers. His job had to do with telegraph relays. If you're not familiar, basically telegraph relays were a wire that went from point A to point B through electromagnetic currents (a transistor). Tommy Flowers basically took those telegraph relays and built a programmable computer. It wasn't like a computer we know today, this computer was literally an entire room made up of wires and pulleys, with electromagnetic currents running through it.
