<b>NASA Experience</b><br>
Co-opat Johnson Space Center from 1991-1995, working in a variety of areas. Shereceived a patent for work done in 1991 on Robot Friendly Probe and SocketAssembly.
<br>
In 1998, oncompleting her doctorate, she accepted a position with the Crew and ThermalSystems Division, working as an Environmental Control Systems Engineer. Herprime responsibility involved using human thermal physiology and engineeringcontrol for improvements in the space suit thermal control system andevaluation of firefighter suit cooling technologies.
<br><br>
Otherresponsibilities included providing computational fluid dynamic analysis forthe TransHab module air distribution system, coordinating and monitoringanalysis tasks performed by a team of contractor personnel for the X-38environmental control and life support system, providing conceptual designs ofthe thermal control system for the Advanced Mars and Lunar Lander Missionstudies, and environmental control system analysis for a collapsible hyperbaricchamber.<br><br>
Selected asa mission specialist by NASA in July 2000, Dr. Nyberg reported for training inAugust 2000. Following the completion of two years of training and evaluation,she was assigned technical duties in the Astronaut Office Station OperationsBranch where she served as Crew Support Astronaut for the Expedition 6 Crewduring their six-month mission aboard the International Space Station. Dr.Nyberg is currently assigned duties in the Space Shuttle Branch and theExploration Branch. She will serve in technical assignments until assigned to aspace flight.<br><br>

<b>Education Round 2</b><br>
She was selected as an Astronaut Candidate by NASA in July 2000. After two years of training and evaluation she qualified as a Mission Specialist and was assigned for technical duties in the Astronaut Office Station Operations Branch. She was Crew Support Astronaut for the Expedition 6 crew during their six-month mission on the ISS. In July 2006, Nyberg took part in NEEMO 10, a deep-sea training and simulation exercise at the Aquarius underwater laboratory to help NASA prepare for the return of astronauts to the moon and manned missions to Mars. Nyberg and her crewmates lived and worked underwater for seven days.[4][5]
<br><br>
Nyberg was in the crew of STS-124, which flew to the ISS in May 2008. This was the second of three flights to deliver components to complete the Japanese Kibo laboratory.[2] In May 2009, she was assigned to the STS-132 mission, which launched in May 2010,[6] but had to be replaced three months later due to a temporary medical condition.[7] Nyberg then served in a technical role until she received her next assignment, as a flight engineer on the Expedition 36/37.
<br><br>
She recently served as a flight engineer on Expedition 36 and Expedition 37 on the ISS, having launched on Soyuz TMA-09M. While in orbit, Nyberg was one of only two women in space on the 50th anniversary on June 16, 2013 of Vostok 6, the first spaceshot by a woman, Valentina Tereshkova, the other being Chinese astronaut Wang Yaping aboard the Tiangong-1 on the Shenzhou 10 mission.[8]
