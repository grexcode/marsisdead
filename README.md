# marsisdead

Hey anyone who finds this weird document. This was a cyber problem created for my students to solve in my ELA class.
We read The Martian by Andy Weir, which is a great book if you haven't read it.
I have a decent understanding of coding and wanted to design a problem for them to solve.
What follows is a small puzzle that requires sleuthing, interacting with code, and solving situations in order to stop a rogue astronaut from destroying the base.
Give it a shot if you want, but I'm sure there are cooler things on here for you to find.
