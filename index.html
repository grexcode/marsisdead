<h1>Greetings former Mars astronauts</h1>
<p align="center">As a disgruntled former employee of the Mars initiative, I've decided to seek my revenge on you, the current settlers of the Mars experience. You may not know who I am or why, exactly, I'm mad, but that's not of any importance now. I would say it's imperative you heed my message, but the truth is you have very little time left. Currently, there are less than two hours remaining before my hack is complete and all Mars systems are stoped. This includes operational, HVAC, mechnical, and safety systems. Everything you know and cherish about your time on Mars (and your life) will cease to exist. <b>You</b> will cease to exist. There's nothing much you can do. Just know that it was entirely your fault, as my colleagues from Mars, and make the most of your time left. I've included a timer so you know just how much time you have remaining.</p>
